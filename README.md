# Algostats Console App
**(Trilogy Skills Bootcamp: Week 04 - Challenge)** by David Heseltine

> **Note**: The methods I selected to implement in the Javascript file were to reflect what we had learnt in week 4 of the course, namely using "for" and "if". While there are other methods available to shorten the length of the code, they were not the focus of this challenge.

# Design Prompt
## Description
This week the task was to build a portfolio page, which I can add to as the course progresses. 

A portfolio of work can showcase skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights a developer's strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. 

With these points in mind, in this challenge I set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.<a href="#references">*[1]*</a>

## Acceptance Criteria
I was given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

My task was to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * The code will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When the code is opened in the browser the resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 25
  Total: $2561231
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
  ```

The final code should print the analysis to the console.
